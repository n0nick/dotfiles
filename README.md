## <s>n0nick's dotfiles</s>

I've been switching over to a new setup, so these are the dotfiles that make it.

Generally it's:

* [Fish shell] for shell and scripting needs.
* [Vim] for text editing (and more).
* [Vundle] for Vim plugins.
* [Tmux] for managing sessions, windows and collaboration.
* [iTerm2] for a terminal window.
* [Chrome] and its Developer Tools for web work.
* Miscellaneous config files (git, ruby, etc.)

I should state that for now, these files are custom sewn for my own computers and usage. That is, it's all for OS X (latest version), and used for high-level programming (mostly Web) and academic study.

Also important -- most of what's here is based on learning and stealing from Yan Pritzker's [YADR], which is the inspiration for my setup. I only switched away from using YADR because I wanted to experiment with Fish shell.

You're free of course to look around, borrow and suggest stuff as you wish. I've attached a copy of the WTF-PL.
