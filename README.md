# n0nick's dotfiles

What I'm using:

* [Zsh] is awesome
* [Prezto] makes my Zsh more awesome
  ([my fork](https://github.com/n0nick/prezto))
* [Vim] for text editing
* [Tmux] for managing sessions, windows and collaboration
* [Chrome] and its DevTools for web work
* [Git] for source control
* Miscellaneous config files (Ctags, Ruby, Hydra, etc.)

I should state that for now, these files are custom sewn for my own computers
and usage. That is, it's all for OS X (latest version), and used for high-level
programming (mostly Web) and academic study.

Also important -- most of what's here is based on learning and stealing from Yan
Pritzker's [YADR], which is the inspiration for my setup.

You're free of course to look around, borrow and suggest stuff as you wish. I've
attached a copy of the WTF-PL.
